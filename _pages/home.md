# ðŸŒŸ Help Owen Find His Superheroâ€”A Kidney Donor ðŸŒŸ
Meet Owen, our brave little warrior who was born with End Stage Renal Disease. At just 18 months old, heâ€™s already faced incredible challenges and multiple surgeries and treatments. Through it all, Owen has shown remarkable strength and resilience, but now heâ€™s ready for the next step: a life-saving kidney transplant.

The only thing missing is his superheroâ€”a donor who can give him the gift of life. We are in a critical moment trying to find a kidney for him and we are asking for your help.

## Could you be Owenâ€™s hero?

We are urgently searching for a living kidney donor. Potential donors should be healthy individuals between the ages of 21 and 55. If you, or someone you know, would consider this incredible act of generosity, weâ€™d love to hear from you.

Hereâ€™s how you can make a difference:

ðŸ”¹ Learn more about becoming a donor and how you can save Owenâ€™s life.

ðŸ”¹ Share Owenâ€™s storyâ€”every share helps spread the word and brings us closer to finding his match.

If you're interested in learning more or contacting us, please email us at babyowenneedsakidney@gmail.com.

Together, we can help our little boy find the superhero he desperately needs. Whether through donating, sharing, or simply spreading the word, your support means everything to us.

With love and gratitude,

Kristen and Dallas

## Owen's Stay In The NICU

<img src="/assets/images/FullSizeRender.png" align="right" width=75%>
At 32 weeks pregnant, an ultrasound revealed that both of Owen's kidneys were very small and underdeveloped. Just a few weeks later, Owen was born critically ill with kidney failure and spent several weeks in the NICU. At just 1 week old he had surgery to have a peritoneal catheter placed in his abdomen and at 3 weeks he began dialysis. During his stay in the NICU he required around the clock monitoring, daily blood draws, and a feeding tube to help him eat.
